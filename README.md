# CSCI 240 Kashyap
A repository of all CSCI 240 projects at NIU fall 2020. These projects were only checked again output examples and testing given by the [course site](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~byrnes/csci240/), and were never officially graded.
# About
Start --> Finish: Dec. 03, 2020 --> TBA 
Hi I am a transfer student coming into NIU for spring 2021. I never took offically took CSCI 240, so by nature, all of these projects were completed on my own time and they were never graded. I wanted to go into the next class, CSCI 241, with as much practice in c++ as I could so I figured what better way than to attempt to do all of the projects for the pre-req class CSCI 240. This is my first time getting familar with C++. Previously I mostly focused on java, python, and some C#. Again it's important to reiterate, *These programs were not graded*. I only moved onto the next program if I was able to satisfy both the program and extra credit requirements and my output matched the given expected outputs (So when in my mind I think I would have gotten >= 100% on the program).
