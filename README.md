# CSCI 240 Kashyap
A repository of all CSCI 240 projects at NIU fall 2020. These projects were only checked again output examples and testing given by the [course site](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~byrnes/csci240/), and were never officially graded.
# About
Hi I am a transfer student coming into NIU for spring 2021. I never took offically took CSCI 240, so by nature, I completed all of these projects on my own time and they were never graded. I wanted to go into the next class, CSCI 241, with as much practice in c++ as I could so I figured what better way than to attempt to do all of the projects for the pre-req class CSCI 240. This is my first time getting familar with C++. Previously I mosted focused on java, python, and some C#.
