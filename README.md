# CSCI 240 Kashyap
A repository of all CSCI 240 projects at NIU fall 2020. These projects were only checked again output examples and testing given by the [course site](http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~byrnes/csci240/), and were never officially graded.
# About
Hi I am a transfer student coming into NIU for spring 2021. I never took offically took CSCI 240, so by nature, all of these projects were completed on my own time and they were never graded. I wanted to go into the next class, CSCI 241, with as much practice in C++ as I could so I figured what better way than to attempt to do all of the projects for the pre-req class CSCI 240. This is my first time getting familar with C++. Previously I mostly focused on java, python, and some C#. Again it's important to reiterate, *these programs were not graded*. I only moved onto the next program if I was able to satisfy both the program and extra credit requirements and my output matched the given expected outputs (So when in my mind I think I would have gotten >= 100% on the program).
# Video Explainations
I did my best to create a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgiazZDGuJZqxZd0TrXD0rsK_9lWAqOD_) that provide a short explaination to the programs. Most of them were done in one take so go easy on me. They say the best way to learn something is to be able to teach it.
