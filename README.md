# csci-240-kashyap
A repository of all CSCI 240 projects at NIU fall 2020.
# About
I never took CSCI 240, so by nature, I completed all of these projects on my own time and they were never graded. I wanted to go into the next class, CSCI 241, with as much practice in c++ as I could so I figured what better way than to attempt to do all of the projects for the pre-req class CSCI 240.
# What I learned
* Project 0
  * How to create a C++ comand line tool project in Xcode.
  * printing hello world :)
* Project 1
  * cout and cin
  * varible types (double)
  * Simple arithmetic to calculate scoring percentage.
